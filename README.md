# ITaskHandler Template and Sample Project

> Provides a sample project to demonstrate using C# to create a Task Scheduler COM Handler and a Visual Studio template project to easily create a custom handler.

### COM Handler Project Template
If you are writing your own custom Task Scheduler COM Handler based on the ITaskHandler interface, there is a [project template](https://github.com/dahall/ITaskHandlerTemplate/tree/master/ITaskHandler%20COM%20Server%20Project%20Template) available that will stub out the majority of the work to create it in C# and a [sample](https://github.com/dahall/ITaskHandlerTemplate/tree/master/COMTask) to show a complete one. If running your own code, this model provides much better interaction, control and memory management than running an executable.
